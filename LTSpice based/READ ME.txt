LTSpice Library for Quantum Thermal Devices under the Intermediate Bath Formalism

Author - Ravi T. Wijesekara

Basic setup instructions - 
	1. Open up LTSpice and go to Tools >> Control Panel.
	2. Go to the 'Sym. & Lib. Search Paths' tab.
	3. Add the directory "...\LTSpice based\Quantum Thermal Library" to both the 'Symbol Search Path' and 'Library Search Path'
	4. Now you should be able to run the test LTSpice files without issue.
	5. To add any quantum thermal device into a circuit, in the 'Component' window (that usually has all the transistors and
		other devices listed), select 'Top directory' as the "...\LTSpice based\Quantum Thermal Library" and the set of devices 
		should appear.
